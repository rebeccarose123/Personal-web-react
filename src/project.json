        "description": "SplittR is a mobile application that allows users to make groups and add receipts to the group, keeping track of expenses and group members share of the total. The app utilizes the mobile devise's camera and the Google Vision API that analyze receipt images to extract the total cost of the bill. Each group can have multiple receipts and splits the group total amount by the number of members to find the each members share. The app also has a feature that allows logged in users to add expenses to those groups and knows the total amount that member has spent for when the group is ready to settle up.",
